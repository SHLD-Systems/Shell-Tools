# 🎉 Shell Scripts Collective

A concise collection of free-to-use shell scripts—clone, explore, and run.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Structure

All scripts live in **`tools/<tool-name>/`**, and each has its own **README**:

```text
tools/pipeshell/README.md
tools/passgen/README.md
tools/template-processor/README.md
...
```

Open any **`tools/<tool-name>/README.md`** for usage details and examples.
There are groups of tools kept under named folders in **`tools/<tool-group>/<tool-name>/README.md`** for some aggregation.
